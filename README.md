<h1> HOA Academy </h1>

This site was created for Dr. Gary Soloman, as a resource for homeowners dealing with troublesome HOAs.

The site was originally created in 2013 using very basic HTML and CSS. I took on the task of revamping the site
to have a more aesthetically pleasing design, while maintaining the content of the original site. 
I used handlebars to handle the repetitive nature of the content.
